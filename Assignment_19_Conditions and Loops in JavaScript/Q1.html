  <h2>Conditional statements</h2>
  <p>Conditional statements, also known as decision-making statements, are used in programming to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. These conditions determine which block of code should be executed.</p>
  <p>There are mainly three types of conditional statements in JavaScript:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>if statement: </b>It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    </li>
    <li><b>if....else statement:</b>It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true; otherwise, it executes another block of code.</li>
    <li><b>switch statement:</b>It selects one of many code blocks to be executed.</li>
  </ol>
  
<hr>
  <ol>
    <li><b>if statement:</b>
    if(condition){
      //code block will execute if condition is true
      Example:
      <img src="asset/asset_1.png" alt="">
      <script>
        let age =20;
        if (age>=18){
          console.log("You are adult");
        }
      </script>
    }
    <hr>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>if...else statement</b>
      if(condition){
        //code of block to be executed if condition is true
      }
      else{
        //code of block to be executed if condition is false
      }
      Example:
      <img src="asset/asset_2.png" alt="">
      <script>
        let temperature = 28
        if (temperature>30){
          console.log("It is too hot.")
        }
        else{
          console.log("It is a pleasant weather.")
        }
      </script>
      <hr>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>switch statement</b>
      switch (expression){
        case value1:
          //Code block to be executed if expression equals value1
          break;
        case value2:
          //Code block to be executed if expression equals value2
          break;
        default:
          // Code block to be executed if expression doesn't match any case 
      }
      Example:
      <img src="asset/asset_3.png" alt="">
      <script>
        let day="Monday";
        switch (day){
          case "Monday":
            console.log("Today is Monday")
            break;
          case "Tuesday":
            console.log("Today is Tuesdy")
            break;
          default:
            console.log("Today is not Monday or Tuesday.");
        }
